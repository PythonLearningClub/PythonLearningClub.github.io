title:  "ML Model API"

#### Team:  
* Idea: Olya S.
* Project Manager: Julia
* Project Developer: Stas


### What:  
  
Create API for getting an ML model predictions for a given dataset. 


### Why:  
  
* Automation of obtaining model predictions process  
* User friendly approach comparing to providing Jupyter notebooks  

### How:  

1. Load saved model from *pickle* file  
2. Load input data from *JSON* file  
3. Using *predict* method obtain prediction  
4. Output prediction as a *JSON* file  

**Challenges:**  

* you should train a model first  
* parse JSON file
* use Flask or REST API  


**Additional challenge:**  
* create a web-page  


### Input:

Let's take a [Boston Housing Dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_boston.html) for ML model development.  
Here is an example of [Linear Regression](https://towardsdatascience.com/linear-regression-on-boston-housing-dataset-f409b7e4a155) trained on this dataset.
